Make a class for a robot! This robot can only drive in a straight line on a field 7 meters long. The robot has a drive base and an arm that can move up and down. Imagine that the arm can pick up and score cubes for 5 points each. Your robot should have these variables:
    * Position
    * Arm position
    * Whether or not it has a piece
    * Score from scoring cubes
The robot class should also have methods to:
    * Move
    * Raise/lower arm
    * Pick up a cube
    * Score a cube
Rules/information:
1. The robot starts at position 0 with no cubes and the arm 0 inches off the ground.
2. A cube can only be picked up when:
    1. The robot is at space 3 (aka 3 meters from starting position)
    2. The arm is 0 inches off the ground
    3. The robot does not already have a cube
3. The robot must be holding a cube 10 inches in the air at space 7 to score it.

Once you have this class created, make a way for the user to control the robot! Use loops and input. Every time the robot does something, make sure to print out information on its position, etc. so the user doesn’t get confused.

This is a pretty big assignment, so don’t be afraid to ask any questions!
