# Assignment #7
## Lesson 7: Functions

1. This homework is fairly simple. Change all your past homeworks (except Lesson 3) into functions. Any starting variables will become function parameters (eg. lesson 5 problem 1â€™s array of 10 words). You can either have all the functions in one file or go back to your old programs and make them into functions.
2. Make a function that tells you if some number is divisible by another number (there should be two parameters). Have it return a boolean, and then tell the user if the number is divisible.
