# Assignment #6
## Lesson 6: Loops

1. Make a program that takes user input and adds it to an array until the user inputs “stop”. “Stop” should not be a part of the array. Then, print out the array.
2. Make an array. It can be any length and have anything in it. Now, make a new array that is the same array but reversed!
    * Hint: have a variable that stores the length of the first array and counts backward!
3. Extra Challenge: Solve the first three problems on [https://projecteuler.net/archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives). Technically, people aren’t supposed to post solutions, but they do so anyways - Google can always help.
