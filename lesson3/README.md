# Assignment #3
## Types
Write a program to test the output of the following:
  1. Are `float(4.6)` and `int(4.6)` the same? If not, how are they different?
  2. What does `int(3.7)` return?
  3. Does `int(“4.5”)` work? Does `int(“4 and 5”)`?
  4. What happens when you try `float(“three point six”)`? Or `float(“three”)`?
  5. Check these one by one and comment out any lines that cause errors.
