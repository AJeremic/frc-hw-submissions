## Lesson 2: Variables
  1. Pizza Shop: Have the user input an order for pizza, then print out their order in one sentence. Have variables for their name, how many pizzas they want, how many pieces of pepperoni, and how many olives. Then print out their order with “(name) ordered (x) pizzas with (y) pepperonis and (z) olives.”
  2. *CHALLENGE*- Get three number inputs from the user. Your task is then to print out the average of the three user inputs. When assigning a variable to a number value, use the following: `variable_name = int (raw_input(“Enter your first number: ”))`
