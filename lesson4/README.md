## Lesson 4.5: The Software Engineering Process
We have an array of patients with values of their weight and height. This program is supposed to return the BMI (Body Mass Index) for with patient in a loop. However, something is not quite right. Time to debug!!
```python
patients = [[70, 1.8], [80, 1.9], [150, 1.7]]
def calculate_bmi(weight, height):
  return weight / (height ** 2)
for patient in patients:
  weight, height = patients[0]
bmi = calculate_bmi(height, weight)
print "Patient's BMI is:" + str(bmi)
```
